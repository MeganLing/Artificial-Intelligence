# Artificial-Intelligence Regressor Report
Produce, following the code we have developed in class and using sknn for the neural network functions, a regressor neural network that successfully (not necessarily at 100% accuracy) predicts wine quality. 
Here is the link to the web page for the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality. You may choose either reds or whites. Here is a bit of background on Portuguese wines: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinho_Verde
